                                                 exists on pub.dev. Or

                                                 "nullsafety" prerelease preid.
                                                 Or "-no-nullsafety" to filter

                                                 "nullsafety" preid.
    --[no-]flutter                               Filter packages where the
                                                 package depends on the Flutter
                                                 SDK. Or "-no-flutter" to filter

                                                 The included packages skip

                                                 The included packages skip
                                                 --ignore and --diff checks.
